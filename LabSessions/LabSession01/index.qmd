## Origin of the Lab Sessions

<!-- [Origin of the Lab Sessions]{.slide-title} -->

* This slide is based on [lab sessions](https://github.com/intro-stat-learning/ISLP_labs) from [An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python](https://hastie.su.domains/ISLP/ISLP_website.pdf.download.html) book.
* You can reach the original lab session files in `.Rmd` and `.ipynb` formats from [here](https://github.com/intro-stat-learning/ISLP_labs/blob/main/Ch02-statlearn-lab.Rmd) and [here](https://github.com/intro-stat-learning/ISLP_labs/blob/main/Ch02-statlearn-lab.ipynb)
* There are *three main* differences between these slides and above mentioned original files:
  * Slides does not require installing Python, Spyder, PyCharm, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab (Although you can use this approach too).
  * Slides have interactive version of the lab session examples. (You will understand what I mean when you see them) 
  * All libraries and dataset will be pre-installed and pre-imported so you don't have to worry about installing packages and importing datasets (Although you should be familiar how to do these.).

## Getting Started

* As you understand from the previous slide, **using these slides** is much easier than the original documents. 
* Yet, some of the packages may not be available for these slides and can not be installed. So, if such a problem arises you can always use the original lab-session documents. 
* To use the original version of the lab sessions you need to do two thing:
  * An installation of `Python3`, which is the specific version of `Python`  used in the labs. 
  * Access to  `Jupyter`, a very popular `Python` interface that runs code through a file called a *notebook*.
