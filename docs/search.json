(You will understand what I mean when you see them)\nAll libraries and dataset will be pre-installed and pre-imported so you don’t have to worry about installing packages and importing datasets (Although you should be familiar how to do these.)."

So, if such a problem arises you can always use the original lab-session documents.\nTo use the original version of the lab sessions you need to do two thing:\n\nAn installation of Python3, which is the specific version of Python used in the labs.\nAccess to Jupyter, a very popular Python interface that runs code through a file called a notebook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLab Session 01 - Intro. to R"

With bookdown I also learned to use GitHub Pages and now I started to use Quarto to add some interactivity on my lecture notes.\nYou can contact with me through linkedin for any enquiry and possible collaboration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
