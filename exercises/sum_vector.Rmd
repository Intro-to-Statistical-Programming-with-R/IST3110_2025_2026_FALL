```{r data generation, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}

v1 <- sample(1:10, 5)

```




Question
========
Consider the following vector in R:
$$v1 = `r v1`$$
What is the output of the following R Code:
$$sum(v1)$$


Solution
========
We need to calculate the sum of all the elements in the vector with a help of r function such as `sum()`.

$$`r v1[1]`+`r v1[2]`+`r v1[3]`+`r v1[4]`+`r v1[5]` = `r sum(v1)`$$


Meta-information
================
extype: num
exsolution: `r sum(v1)`
extol: 0.01
exname: sum of a vector
