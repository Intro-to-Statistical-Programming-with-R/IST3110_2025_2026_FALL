* I am Erhan Cene, working as an associate professor at the Yildiz Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey in the department of statistics ([see university webpage](https://avesis.yildiz.edu.tr/ecene "personal webpage")).
* My broad research interest is on data science and statistical programming especially (**but not limited to**) in sports analytics and biostatistics ([see publication list](https://avesis.yildiz.edu.tr/ecene/yayinlar "publication list")).
* I mostly give programming courses such as `Introduction to Python`, `Statistical Programming with R`, `Database` and `Web Programming` along with the `Sampling 1` course at the undergraduate level and `Data Manipulation and Visualisation` course at the graduate level. 
* I started to prepare the lecture notes in Rmarkdown format a few years ago, then combined them via `bookdown` package for better and tidy look. With bookdown I also learned to use   GitHub Pages and now I started to use Quarto to add some interactivity on my lecture notes.
* You can contact with me through [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erhan-%C3%A7ene-03488960/) for any enquiry and possible collaboration.
