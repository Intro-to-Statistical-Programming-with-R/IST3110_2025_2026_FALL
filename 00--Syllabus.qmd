## Some useful websites to get help

Typically, a problem you may be encountering is not new and others have faced,
solved, and documented the same issue online.

* The following resources can be used to search for online help. Although, I typically just google the problem and find answers relatively quickly.
* **RSiteSearch("key phrase"):** searches for the key phrase in help manuals and archived mailing lists on the R Project website at http://search.r-project.org/.
* **Stack Overflow:** a searchable Q&A site oriented toward programming issues. 75 % of my answers typically come from Stack Overflow questions tagged for R at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r.
* **Cross Validated:** a searchable Q&A site oriented toward statistical analysis. Many questions regarding specific statistical functions in R are tagged for R at http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/r.
* **R--seek:** a Google custom search that is focused on R-specific websites. Located at http://rseek.org/
* **R -bloggers:** a central hub of content collected from over 500 bloggers who provide news and tutorials about R. Located at http://www.r-bloggers.com/
* **ChatGPT** obviously.
